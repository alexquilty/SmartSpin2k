The Default knob cup. 

Inserts get printed separately and then slide into this. 

If you're making the SmartSpin2k for a specific bike and don't want future customization, you could take this part, combine your insert in Cura (or another slicer) and then print them as one piece. 

The Knob Cup HEX is for if you'd like a metal output shaft using a 5/16" bolt.
