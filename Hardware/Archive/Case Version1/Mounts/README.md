Which mount do I need?

Currently the Mounting_Strap_Rigid is recommended for most uses. Lash the long end to your headtube with Rubber Bands or a velcro strap. 

Other files in this library are: 

* LoganReentionClip or PositiveRetentionClip can be used instead of rubber bands or velcro for securing. 
* BakerEchelonStrap is designed by @jkbaker4 for an Echelon Connect Spin Bike. 
* MountingStrapV2 is an updated version of the original mounting strap that works well for most bikes like the IC4 but provides some flex.
* MountingStrapV2_XL is an "extra long" version of V2.  
* Flywheel_Brand_Mounting_Strap is a design for Flywheel Brand bikes and is not effective/complete.
