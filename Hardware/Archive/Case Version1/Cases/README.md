Which case do I need?

Use the Bottom_Case for the whole DIY experience. It provides additional mounts inside for the stepper driver and the buck converter. 

The Bottom_Case_PCB is for those that use the pcb from pcbway. It's much simplier and cleaner wiring but requires more parts to be purchased (Components for the PCB).
